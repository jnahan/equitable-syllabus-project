[Check out the website here](https://itp.nyu.edu/esp/#/)

The Equitable Syllabus Project at NYU‚Äôs ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program) department provides resources to help faculty create inclusive and equitable syllabus. This website provides a centralized location professors can visit to find and utilize these resources. 

The resources provided include:
- Syllabus Guide: template to help professors develop their course syllabus
- Research Database: filterable database of equity-centered resources
- Research Assistance Service: get help finding resources for your syllabus
- Syllabus Review Workshop: collaborative workshop sessions to rework your syllabus

This project was designed in Figma and developed with React. SheetsDB API was used to create the database as the original database was hosted on Google Sheets, and this API allowed researchers to continue finding and logging new resources easily.
